-------------------------------------------

Jupyter notebook

	analysis_pipeline.ipynb

contains Python code implementing all steps of the pupillometry analysis proposed in above mentioned manuscript.
Python packages required to run the code are listed in

	requirements.txt

and can be installed via

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Folder /data/ contains the data forming the basis of the study.
Executing all code cells of the notebook sequentially will produce four output files with processed
data as well as a plot corresponding to Fig.9AC of the manuscript.
Extensive docstrings and inline code comments as well as cross-references to corresponding sections
of the manuscript which detail the data analysis steps are provided throughout the notebook.
